## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project came from the desire to transform the classic "Hello World" program into a visually captivating experience. I wanted to take the traditional first step of programming and elevate it with modern web technologies, creating a dynamic and interactive canvas animation.

## What it does

The project uses HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript to animate thousands of particles that move across the screen, forming and dissolving the phrase "Hello World". Each particle follows a flow field, creating a mesmerizing visual effect that brings the static text to life.

## How I built it

I built the project using JavaScript to manipulate the HTML5 Canvas. I created a ```Particle``` class to define the behaviour of individual particles and an ```Effect``` class to manage the overall animation. The particles' movement is influenced by a flow field, which is generated based on pixel data from the text drawn on the canvas.

## Challenges I ran into

One of the main challenges was optimizing the performance to handle a large number of particles without causing lag. I also faced difficulties in creating a flow field that would convincingly guide the particles to form the desired text.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I am proud of creating a complex and beautiful animation from a simple concept. The project not only displays "Hello World" but does so in a way that is both technically impressive and visually stunning.

## What I learned

I learned advanced techniques for canvas manipulation, particle system optimization, and the intricacies of creating a flow field based on text. I also gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript's capabilities in creating interactive web-based animations.

## What's next for Creative coding: Hello World

The next step for the "Hello World" project is to add interactivity, allowing users to interact with the particles in real-time. I also plan to explore different visual effects and perhaps integrate the animation with other web technologies or APIs to create an even more engaging user experience.
